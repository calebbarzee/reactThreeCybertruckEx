# reactThreeCybertruckEx
An example of the React Three library functionality in rendering 3D objects


# Overview

I wanted to learn more about the React Three Library features. It seemed like a convenient way to render 3D objects in a web browser due to its modularity of components and clean, declarative syntax style. 

I wrote an app demonstrating the 3D rendering of a cybertruck over a green plane. This exercise included: initializing and configuring a React Web App, using Node Package Manager to get dependencies needed for 3D rendering, exporting GLTF files from Blender, compresing GLTF files using Draco compression tooling, generating JSX given a GLTF file via GLTFJSK tooling, configuring React Three Canvas scene and components.

# Web Pages

During this sprint I created two web pages. One was a 3D Torus visual and the other was the more complex 3D Cybertruck visual.

# Development Environment

I used the React Javascript Framework with some of the React-Three libraries.

Javascript (JSX)

# Useful Websites

* [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com)
* [React JS](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)
* [React Three Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/your-first-scene)

# Future Work

* Implementation of physics to scene
* Fixed camera position relative to object
* User controlled phsics functional input; Ex. driving the truck
